RESULTS

Sentiment Analysis
The CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy of 89.06%. This indicates its ability to correctly classify reviews into positive or negative sentiments. The precision of 90.65% demonstrates the model's capability to correctly identify positive instances, while the recall of 92.36% signifies its effectiveness in capturing the majority of actual positive cases. The F1 Score of 91.50% suggests a well-balanced performance between precision and recall in sentiment classification.

The confusion matrix provides a snapshot of a sentiment analysis model's performance. With 49,288 correct positive predictions (True Positives) and 25,594 correct negative predictions (True Negatives), the model demonstrates proficiency. However, 4,325 instances of falsely identified positive sentiments (False Positives) and 4,930 instances of missed positive sentiments (False Negatives) indicate areas for refinement. Precision, recall, and other metrics derived from these values offer a more nuanced evaluation of the model's effectiveness in classifying sentiments.

Review Summarization
The summarization method's performance was assessed using the ROUGE metrics, specifically ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L.
Precision: Achieved a perfect precision score of 1.0 for both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L, indicating that all generated n-grams in the summaries were present in the reference summaries.
Recall: Recorded an extremely low recall of 0.2% for both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L, indicating a significant challenge in capturing the entirety of important information from the source text.
F1 Score: Exhibited low F1 Scores of 0.4% for both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L, reflecting the struggle to balance precision and recall in the summarization process.
Bert - BLEU Score of 0.24 suggests a moderate level of similarity. However, the detailed analysis revealed specific linguistic characteristics in the reference summaries that the model struggled to capture. These include nuanced phrasing, context preservation, and handling of domain-specific terms.

Product Comparison 
Our chosen assessment metrics for evaluating performance were Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).
Mean Average Precision (MAP)
A MAP score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision, signifying that the recommendation system flawlessly presented all relevant items at the top of the ranking for the selected product. This exceptional result suggests optimal performance in retrieving and ranking relevant items.
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
An NDCG score of 1.0 indicates optimal performance for the selected product. This implies that the recommendation system achieved perfect relevance in presenting items, considering the graded relevance of each retrieved item.

Recommendation Systems
RMSE and MAE serve as our chosen evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of our recommendation system
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
An RMSE value of 1.4561 indicates a moderate level of accuracy. On average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual values by approximately 1.46 units. While this suggests reasonably accurate predictions, there is room for improvement to further minimize errors.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
An MAE of 1.1937 reveals an average absolute difference of approximately 1.19 units between predicted and actual values. This reinforces the model's accuracy, though there is still scope for refinement.
